FlashMandel "BurningShip" Vamped Edition
(Short: FMVE "BurningShip")

This is further developped and amplified "Vamped Edition" of FlashMandel V2.0 published 
by Dino Papararo in 2001. FMVE is a ´hybrid´ program in the sense that many features should 
continue to work on "classic Amiga" (currently not much tested). If it is present the Vampire 
card is autodetected and Vampire specific features and optimizations are used.

NEW FEATURES

Vampire optimizations, e.g.:
- Use 3-operant functionality of FPU and additional registers (e.g: fadd e1,e3,e5)
- Parallelize Mandelbrot/Julia set calculation by using free cpu/fpu latencies
- Speed improvement is around 30% compared to "classic" version.
- Possibility to switch forth and back between classic and optimized via menu or keyboard
- Direct and fast drawing to screenbuffer (with possibility to switch back to AmigaOS
functions if desired)

New fractals:
- Multibrot (including fractional powers > 1.0)
- BurningShip 
- Buddhabrot (Nebulabrots)

New calculation algorithms (available for all fractals):
- Brute force
- Tiling (original algorithm by Dino Papararo)
- Boundary trace
- Random drawing (for Nebulabrots)
- Symmetry (for main view, if possible)

New coloring algorithms (besides "classic iteration count") for 24bit modes:
- Renormalized iteration count
- Cyclic Sinus Coloring (like FlashMandelNG)
- Three channel 24bit coloring for Nebulabrots

New file format:
- Support for Deep IFF (ILBM) Images (24bit truecolor)
- New data chunk to include all calculation data
- Histogram file for Buddhabrot (with RLE compression)
- Backwards compatibility with old formats (pictures and palettes)

New features / functions:
- Real time visualization of orbits (in main view for all fractals)
- Nebulabrot calculation can be stopped and resumed
- Bailout value can be modified

New pictures:
- Sample pictures for new fractals have been included
- Nice splash screen and new icon

As with the original program all source files are bundled with the program and you can use
it for whatever you want to use them!

Compile and link with SAS/C and VASM:

vasm -m68080 -Fhunk source_file.s -o object_file.o
sc link FlashMandel detectvamp.o

Or (easier), by typing:

smake

in the main folder.

Thanks for Dino Papararo for his advice and permission to continue development for this
new 68k version of FlashMandel.

Have fun!

**********************************************************************************************

Readme from the original author (V2.0):

Full functional program for rendering Mandelbrot & Julia fractals in about 62k of code with many nice features.
Support for ECS/AGA/RTG and 68020/68060 Amiga with an FPU.
C & Asm 68k source included !

FlashMandel is Giftware, If you like it just sent nice goodies to author just like $ or gold medals ;-))

**********************************************************************************************

New in this version:

 Removed a stupid enforcer hit when accepting new limits.

 I forgot to allocate the memory for the font name record... bugfixed sorry!

 Now all pictures and palettes saved have a copyright note chunk inside.

 Now when 'TAB' key is pressed during a rendering the skipped zone is hilighted 5 times.

 You can show the guide choosing "Help..." from project menu or hitting the 'HELP' key into main window in asyncronous way.

 Minor but important internal code changes with potential bugs removed.

 Replaced 1 Julia picture and reworked a bit 2 palettes.

 *** Added into source directory an assembly PPC routine never tested and implemented but it should be a realtime routine ;-)

***********************************************************************************************
*If you are an Amiga programmer and like FlashMandel contact me for a PPC porting under WarpOS*
*or better MorphOS with REALTIME rendering and deeper calculations.                           *
